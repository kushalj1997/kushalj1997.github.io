### Focus, Goals, and Interests
- Apply Software Engineering to Solve Difficult Problems
- Write clean, performant, maintainable code in C/C++, Python, and use software as a creative outlet to bring things to life.
- Work with artificially intelligent technologies to enable robust autonomous vehicles. Understand perception (computer vision, machine/deep/reinforcement learning), localization (SLAM, graph search, probabilistic methods), and path planning (A*, Kalman Filtering, etc.) and all parts of the AV stack.
- Connect Brains and Computers.
- Create a symbiotic relationship with artificial intelligence through development of high speed brain computer interfaces that provide high resolution, localizable data that is clear, denoised, and trivial to analyze. Understand the neural correlates of consciousness, and create technology that can understand thought patterns, read, and write into the brain.
